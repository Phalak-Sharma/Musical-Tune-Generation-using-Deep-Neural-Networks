# Musical-Tune-Generation-using-Deep-Neural-Networks


**ABSTRACT**
With the advancement of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, computers are able to show such human-like behaviours which can just be imagined about. Generating new things by learning from the old ones is just a simple task for the machines like prediction, new image captions or learning from previous texts etc. Another challenging task is the  generation of music by learning from the old ones. This is a form of unstructured data which becomes quite complex to handle. Here we have taken up the project of Musical Tune Generation. It aims at generating new decent musical tunes by providing some audio input to it. Our task was to take some existing music data and then train a model using it. The model learnt the patterns in the old music files that we humans enjoy. After that, the model should be able to generate new music. We have been able to generate a decent quality music which is melodious and good to hear. In this project we used Neural Networks to make our model learn musical tunes. Particularly, we have worked on Wavenet and LSTM architectures for the generation of new tunes. The two parameters used in the project are length of the input sequence and minimum number of unique notes that are present in the training dataset files. We also presented a comparative analysis for different pairs of combinations for these two parameters. The artificial generation of musical tunes however poses several challenges. The foremost being as to how to encode various features in the musical tune. Following it would be a challenge to maintain the structure and dynamics of the tune generated. One more outcome from the project is that we have been able to conclude that out of the two models, LSTM works better as the tunes generated are melodious and pleasant.
